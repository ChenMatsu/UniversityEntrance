### Extrema

> $f(c)$ is a local maximum value of $f(x)$ if $f(x) \ge f(x)$ for all $x$ near $c$
> 
> $f(c)$ is a local minimum value of $f(x)$ if $f(x) \le f(x)$ for all $x$ near $c$


A **critical number** $c$ in the domain of $f$ has either $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ D.N.E.

**Fermat Theorem**
> Every relative max/min occurs at a critical number

1. Find all critical numbers in domain
2. Compute $f(x)$ for each critical number and each endpoint
3. Compare the outputs to find relative and absolute max/mins

- **Concave up** on an open interval if $f'(x)$ is incresaing
  - $f''(x) > 0$
- **Concave down** on an open interval if $f'(x)$ is incresaing
  - $f''(x) < 0$

> An **inflection point** on a graph is where the concavity changes, $f''(c) =  0$ or $f''(c)$ D.N.E

**Second Derivative Test**
1. $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) < 0$ => Local maximum
2. $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) > 0$ => Local minimum
3. $f'(c) = 0$ and $f''(c) = 0$ => Underterminant
