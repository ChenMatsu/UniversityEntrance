### Minimum Surface

What is the height of a square-based box with volume $100$ units cubed has minimal surface area?

$$
    V = 100 = w^2h, \quad x = \dfrac{10}{\sqrt y}
$$

$$
    SA = 2x^2 + 4xy = 2\dfrac{100}{y} + 4\dfrac{10}{\sqrt y}y
$$

$$
    SA' = -\dfrac{200}{y^2} + \dfrac{20}{\sqrt y} = 0, \quad y = 100^{1/3}
$$
