### Maximum Volume Box with Fixed Surface Area

A square-bottomed box (without a top) is made out of $12000cm^2$ of material. What dimensions give the maximum volume?

**Constraining Equation**
$$
    12000cm^2 = L^2 + 4LH
$$

**Optimizing Equation**
$$
    V = L^2H
$$

$$
    H = \dfrac{12000cm^2 - L^2}{4L}
$$

$$
    V = L^2(\dfrac{12000cm^2 - L^2}{4L})
$$

$$
    V' = 3000cm^2 - \dfrac{3L^2}{4} = 0, \space L = 20\sqrt 10cm, H = 10\sqrt{10}
$$
