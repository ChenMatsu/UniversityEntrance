### A Tale of Three Functions

$$
    f(x) = x + 1
$$

$$
    g(x) = \dfrac{x^2-1}{x^1}
$$

$$
    \begin{align*}
        h(x) = \begin{cases} x + 1, & x \ne 1 \\ 3, & x = 1 \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
$$

There three functions are almost the same, however, there are small difference. In $g(x), x = 1$ is not defined, and $h(x), x = 1$ point is not on the line.

$$
    \lim_{x\to a}f(x) = L
$$

> We can make $f(x)$ arbitrarily close to L by choosing x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a.
