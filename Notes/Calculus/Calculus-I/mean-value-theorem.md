### Mean Value Theorem

> The slope of the secant line on $[a,b]$ is the slope of the tangent line at some point $c$ in $(a,b)$

$$
    \dfrac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(c)
$$

> For $f(x)$ differentiable on $(a,b)$, and continuous on $[a,b]$

**Rolle Theorem**

> For $f(x)$ differentiable on $(a,b)$ and continuous on $[a,b]$, $f(a) = f(b)$ then $f'(c) = 0$ for some $c$ in $(a,b)$
