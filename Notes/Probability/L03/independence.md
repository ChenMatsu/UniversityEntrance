### Independence
> Beliefs are not changed

- **Intuitive Definition**: $P(B|A) = P(B)$
  - occurrence of A provides no new information about B

$$
    P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(A)P(B)
$$

---

Events are called independent if:

$$
    P(A_i \cap A_j \cap ... \cap A_m) = P(A_i)P(A_j)...P(A_m)
$$
