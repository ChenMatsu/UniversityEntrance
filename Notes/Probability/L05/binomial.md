### Binomial

- Experiment: $n$ independent tosses of a coin with $P(Heads) = p$
- Sample Space: Set of sequences of H and T, of length n
- Random Variable X: number of Heads observed
- Model: number of successes in a given number of independent trials

$$
    P_X(k) = \begin{pmatrix} n \\\ k \end{pmatrix}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}
$$
