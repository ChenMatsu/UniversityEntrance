### Geometric

- Experiment: Infinitely many independent tosses of a coin $P(Heads) = p$
- Sample Space: Set of infinite sequences of H and T
- Random Variable X: number of tosses until the first Heads
- Model: Waiting times; number of trials until a success

$$
    P_X(k) = P(X=k) = P(T....TH) = (1-p)^{k-1}p
